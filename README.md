# Web Scraping Project

This project is a simple web scraping script that fetches and prints the latest news headlines from the BBC News website.

***Prerequisites***

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

+ requests
+ beautifulsoup4

You can install these libraries using pip:pip install requests beautifulsoup4

# Troubleshooting

- No Headlines Found:
If the script doesn't print any headlines, the structure of the BBC News website might have changed. Check the HTML snippet printed by the script and adjust the find_all method accordingly.
